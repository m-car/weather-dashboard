# weather-dashboard

## Description 
Using the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), I created a small dashboard that pulls weather data for the current day, and provides a 5 day forecast.

## How to Use
1. Point your browser to : https://m-car.github.io/weather-dashboard/
2. Either select one of the premade buttons or enter in a city name in the search bar and hit enter, or click search. 
3. Current weather will be displayed on top, and a 5 day forecast for this area will be displayed below that.
